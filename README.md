## Site 1
* https://www.collusion.com/
* I was looking for jeans in different online stores and accindentally stumbled upon this website.
* It looks very trendy. Because of the layout, colours, photograhy and typefaces used.
* The navigation system is very simple. Just different cathegories on the top of the page, as well as a couple of drop down menues in some of those cathegories. 
* Not a lot of interactive stuff. Navigation menu, photos and tags. And it's mostly just the change of the colour of the object after hovering over it. A lot of links to other pages and an option to type in the user's email.
* I like it a lot. I thought it was really cool and unique the first time I saw it. Looks super stylish and I think it really suits the theme. Very cool layout and the moving text on the left side of the page makes it even cooler. I was pleased to see that there's no fixed bar at the top af the page, beacuse I think those are ridiculous. The colours used are great!No super saturated, almost pastel. I'm a fan.
* The way they list the items they're selling is a bit cofusing and not very familiar for the users. So I would probably change that and make it a bit more clear.
